Baysian inference is the $probability of the data * prior productivity/{normalisation to a probability}$


```{r grid_aprox}
p_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)
prob_p <- rep(1,1000)
prob_data <- dbinom(6, size = 9, prob = p_grid)
posterior <- prob_data * prob_p
posterior <- posterior/sum(posterior)

plot(p_grid)
plot(prob_p) # plot the prior
plot(prob_data)
points(posterior, col = "blue")
```

```{r}
p <- 10000
samples <- sample(p, prob = posterior, size = 1e4, replace = TRUE)
```
Confidence intervals or any intervals have no meaning and there could be infinite number of intervals.
