# StatisticalRethinkingStudyGroup
Contains links and material to assist participants of the ANZORN [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) Study Group.

## Statistical Rethinking  
[Statitical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is a Bayesian statistics course/book presented by [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/).

## Study Group Genesis
The idea for this group grew from the discussions between [myself](https://github.com/PaulMelloy) and [Adam Sparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks). 
In an effort to commit to completing the study material, and not get distracted by work, we proposed committing to a study group to work through each chapter/ module once a week and meet to discuss the material. 
We decided to open the group to our peers at [ANZORN](https://www.anzopenresearch.org/) whom meet regularly and show interest in participating in the study group.  

## Group meetings  
The study group is likely to meet (pending group consensus) on 'Gather.Town' concurrently / after, the weekly ANZORN meet-up.
Starting with Chapter 1 'The Golem of Prague' in the first week of August 2020. 
Late comers are still welcome to join in and catch up to the group. 
The pace at which we will work through the material will not be onerous and likely take 17 weeks (one week per chapter), concluding on the last week of November. 
This will allow participants to catch up if they fall behind in some weeks.  

## How to join  
You can [join the ANZORN slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/anzorn/shared_invite/zt-68encgjn-uftY95BIMQQ4jXfxoLo0oA), where links to the weekly online meetings are posted.  

## Draft study group discussion points  
  - Informal poll for who completion the chapter of study material, and who had week more thrilling than the SR material.  
  - Open for general discussion about the chapter.  
  - Discussion on challenge questions and the answers, at the end of each chapter.  
  - How participants might apply the aspects in each chapter to their own work.  
  - Set out the goals for next weeks material.  
  - Conclusion and adjournment of the study group till the next meeting.
